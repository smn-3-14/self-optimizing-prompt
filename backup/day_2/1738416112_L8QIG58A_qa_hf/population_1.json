Based on the sentence you provided, the best formula from the options given in the question is:\n\nB: (L \u2022 H) \u2228 I\n\nHere's why:\n\nThe sentence you provided is stating that turtles live long lives and are happy creatures, unless they are injured. To represent this in a formal logic formula, we need to use a disjunction (\u2228) operator, which allows us to connect two statements and say that at least one of them is true. In this case, we want to say that either the turtles live long lives or they are happy creatures, or they are injured. Therefore, the best formula is (L \u2022 H) \u2228 I.\n\nThe other options are not correct because they do not accurately represent the sentence you provided:\n\n* Option A: (L \u2022 H) \u2261 I is not correct because it is saying that",
