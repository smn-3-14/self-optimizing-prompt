Let's start with the first task.\n\nTask 1: Exchange Elements Between Two Lists\n\nDescription: Given two lists of numbers, determine whether it is possible to exchange elements between them to make all the elements of one list even. If it is possible, return \"YES\". Otherwise, return \"NO\".\n\nSample Solution:\n```\ndef exchange(lst1, lst2):\n    # Initialize two variables to keep track of the number of exchanged elements\n    num_exchanged = 0\n    even_lst = []\n\n    # Loop through the elements of lst1\n    for num in lst1:\n        # Check if the element is even\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            # If the element is even, exchange it with a random element from lst2\n            random_num = lst2[-1]\n            lst2.pop()\n            lst1.pop", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1738422540, "model": "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "3.0.1-sha-bb9095a", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 200, "prompt_tokens": 291, "total_tokens": 491}}, "HumanEval/144": {"id": "", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "length", "index": 0, "logprobs": null, "message": {"content": "  Great, let's get started! Here's the solution for the `simplify` function in Python:\n```python\ndef simplify(x, n):\n    # Check if n is a multiple of x\n    if n == x:\n        return True\n    # Check if n is not a valid fraction.\n    # If n is a whole number.\n    # Check if x, n is a fraction.\n\n    # Check if x, n is a valid fraction.\n    # Check if n is a multiple of x.\n    if n % x == 0:\n        return True\n    # Check if n is a whole number.\n    return not isinstance(x, Decimal) or not isinstance(n, Decimal)\n```\nExplanation:\n\nThe `simplify` function takes two arguments `x` and `n`, which are fractions represented as strings.
