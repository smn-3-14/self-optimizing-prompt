Normal cells move through the cell cycle in a regulated way. At the checkpoint stage, they use information about their own internal state and cues from the environment around them to decide whether to proceed with cell division. Cues like these act by changing the activity of core cell cycle regulators inside the cell. The most common regulators are cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases.
