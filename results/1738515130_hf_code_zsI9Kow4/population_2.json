Write a function that takes a string as input and returns `True` if the string is a valid bracket, and `False` otherwise.\n2. Start by checking if the string is a single character. If it is, then it's not a valid bracket (because brackets should have at least two characters). So, return `False`.\n3. Otherwise, check if the string is a valid opening or closing bracket. You can do this by checking if the string is one of the following:\n\t* \"(\" (opening bracket)\n\t* \"[\" (opening square bracket)\n\t* \")\" (closing bracket)\n\t* \"]\" (closing square bracket)\n\tIf the", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1738516218, "model": "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "3.0.1-sha-bb9095a", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 200, "prompt_tokens": 279, "total_tokens": 479}, "passed": false}, "HumanEval/157": {"id": "", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "length", "index": 0, "logprobs": null, "message": {"content": "  Great!
